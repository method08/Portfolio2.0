            <h4>Mission Statement</h4>
            <p>I am a new software developer teaching myself so I can bring to life a plethora of ideas
                and projects that require expertise in coding, lest I am willing and able to pay tens
                if not hundreds of thousands of dollars to a software development firm. As a matter of fact,
                I decided to make my own software development firm, for which this page is the beginning.

            <h4>Codecademy Coursework</h4>
            <p>I began studying programming, or <span class="definition">coding</span>, on August 6th.
            I was immediately obsessed and still, with an average 3 hours per day spent in concentrated study,
            I am fascinated by the art and science of software development. I recently finished the first two units,
            which have taken roughly 60 hours of concentrated study and counting if you include this website.
            <br><br></p>
            <h4>What Is "Method 08"?</h4>
            <p>
                The name "Method08" was actually given to me as a username when I signed up to Codecademy.
                It interested me as I learned what a method actually was: a function within an object.
                Since I have such a fascination with an overwhelming number of topics,
                perhaps I am the object and coding is (at least) my 8th "method".
